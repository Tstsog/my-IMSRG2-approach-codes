## Introduction: 

The Matlab codes computes the ground state energy for helium atom using the solving the flow-type equation combined with an imaginary time (it) generator
in the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG(2)) method. The 2s and 5s GTO, and cc-pVDZ basis sets are used.    

## Requirement: 
Any version of Matlab
